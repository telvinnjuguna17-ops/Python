# Loops -> sometimes we may need to do a piece of work a number of times repeated times in such cases we may use loops.
# A loop is a control structure that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
# There are two type of loops in python i.e : The for loop and the while loop

# Below is the syntax of the for loop in python:

"""
for variable in range(n):
    # block of code to be executed
"""

for greeting in range(5):
    print("Hello", greeting)

print("===========================") 

for  number in range(10,21):
 print(number)



print("===========================")
# find the even numbers in the range of 50 to 71
for number in range(50,71,2):
   print(number)


print("===========================")
# create a python program that prints the odd numbers from 100 to 150
for number in range(101,150,2):
    print(number)

print("===========================")
# create a program that prints the multiples of three from 201 to 150
for number in range(201, 149, -1):
    if number % 3 == 0:
        print(number)

print("===========================")
# Create a python program that prints the leap years in between 2000 and 2024
for number in range(2000,2025,4):
     print(number)
