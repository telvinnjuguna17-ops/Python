# Test 1
# By the use of a function that accepts parameters , calculate the simple interest given principal as 45000 ,rate is 7% and the time take is 8 years .(si = p*r*t/100)
# use the same function inside of a loop to calculate two other simple interest . Note use your own principal ,rate and time.

def  multiply(num1,num2,num3):
    product = num1 * num2 * num3
    print("The product is:",product)

multiply(45000,7,8/100)
